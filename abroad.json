In 1987, the Polytechnic was renamed as South Bank Polytechnic and was given the right to confer research degrees in 1990. The next year, it merged with South West London College and Central Catering College at Waterloo. It received university status in 1992 and became South Bank University. It was finally given its current name on 1st September 2003...",
